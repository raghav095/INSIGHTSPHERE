# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Steps (Already Done!)

- [x] Removed unnecessary files (demo-data.js, currents-api-alternative.js)
- [x] Cleaned up script references
- [x] Added vercel.json configuration
- [x] Set up caching for better performance
- [x] Configured Guardian API integration

## 📋 What You Need to Do NOW:

### Step 1: Test Locally (Optional but Recommended)
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Complete the registration with any name/email and select categories
3. Verify you see real news articles loading
4. Test search functionality

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Vercel deployment with real news API"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up/login with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select your "News-App" repository
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Wait ~30 seconds - Your app will be LIVE! 🎉

### Step 4: Get Real API Key (Optional)
Current setup works with "test" key, but for production:
1. Visit: https://open-platform.theguardian.com/access/
2. Fill registration form (30 seconds)
3. Get your free API key
4. Replace "test" in `config.js` with your real key
5. Push update to GitHub (auto-deploys to Vercel)

## 🎯 Expected Result After Deployment:

✅ Registration page loads first (index.html)  
✅ User fills name, email, selects categories  
✅ Redirects to main news page (mainpage.html)  
✅ Real Guardian news articles load automatically  
✅ Search works for any topic  
✅ Category filtering works  
✅ Dark/light theme toggle works  
✅ Mobile responsive  

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:
